			<h2>Solving the 3x3 Rubik's Cube</h2>
			<p>So you want to learn how to solve the rubik's cube?
				Well, in this article I will teach you a simple method
				to do just that.
			</p>
			<p>This tutorial may seem more complicated than others you have seen.
				While it is true that there are many tutorials that claim to
				solve the rubik's cube in 10 moves or less, they are all lying
				to you. There is no magic move or set of moves to solve the rubik's cube.
				Every person in history to have solved it either got lucky,
				or they followed a procedure similar to this one to reduce any scramble
				to simple, manageable steps.
			</p>
			<p>This article walks through one of the simplest methods to solve
				a 3x3 rubik's cube known as the <em>Beginner Method.</em> There are many
				other methods out there, but they usually involve more complicated
				steps and have more things you need to learn and memorize.
				The most popular is known as <em>CFOP.</em>
				If you want a more advanced method, you should go check that out.
			</p>
			<p>The Beginner Method is a layer-by-layer approach, which means that
				instead of solving one color at a time, you split the cube into
				three "layers" stacked on top of one another.
				Each layer consists of multiple phases:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The First Layer:
					<ul>
						<li>The White Cross</li>
						<li>The White Corners</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The Second Layer:
					<ul>
						<li>Second Layer Edges</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The Third Layer:
					<ul>
						<li>The Yellow Cross
							<ul>
								<li>Orientation of the Edges</li>
								<li>Alignment of the Cross</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>The Yellow Corners
							<ul>
								<li>Positioning of the Corners</li>
								<li>Orientation of the Corners</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Each step completed:</p>

		</section>
		<section>
			<h2 id="whiteCrossHead">Solving the White Cross</h2>
			<p>First, you must solve the white cross.
				When you have finished this step, the cube will look like this
				(the gray pieces indicate that the piece could be any color,
				we don't care what the rest of the cube looks like right now):
			</p>
			<figure class="cube" id="whiteCross1"></figure>
			<script>createCube("whiteCross1");</script>
			<p>Each edge piece with white on it will be between the white center
				and the center of the other color on that piece. (For example,
				the white-blue edge piece is touching the white center and the blue center).
			</p>
			<aside>
				<p>Notice I said edge <em>piece.</em> This is important because
					while there are 54 stickers on the cube (6 sides with 9 stickers each),
					there are actually only 20 moving pieces.
				</p>
				<p>The colors on each piece are stuck together, and can never change.
					This means that for a piece to be solved, <em>all</em> the colors on it
					must match the sides they're on.
				</p>
				<p>There are three types of pieces:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Center pieces (6),</strong> which have only one color, and do
							not move because they are all attached to each other.
							<img src="media/centers.png" alt="rubik's cube core" />
						</li>
						<li><strong>Edge pieces (12),</strong> which have two colors, and touch the
							center pieces and corner pieces.
							<img src="media/edges.png" alt="rubik's cube edge pieces" /> And
						</li>
						<li><strong>Corner pieces (8),</strong> which have three colors,
							and only touch edge pieces.
							<img src="media/corners.png" alt="rubik's cube corner pieces" />
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>A common, and very natural, way to try to solve the rubik's cube
					is by solving one color or side at a time. But since pieces are
					inseparable, a better strategy is to solve the cube one <em>layer</em>
					at a time. The color most people start with is white, so in this tutorial
					the layer we will start with is white as well. You do not have
					to do it this way, but it makes it easier to understand the instructions.
				</p>
			</aside>
			<p>To start solving the rubik's cube, we hold the cube with the white
				center on top, which will put the yellow center on the bottom
				since they are always opposite from each other.
			</p>
			<p>We solve the white cross one piece at a time, so first,
				you need to find a white edge. To solve it, turn the cube until
				the piece is touching the yellow center (so the piece is on the bottom).
				Then turn the bottom until the side color of the piece matches one
				of the centers.
			</p>
			<figure class="cube" id="matchEdge"></figure>
			<script>createCube("matchEdge");</script>
			<figure class="cube" id="matchEdgeB"></figure>
			<script>createCube("matchEdgeB");</script>
			<p>If that's impossible, look at the color on the other side of the piece
				(on the bottom of the cube), and hold that color center facing towards you
				(still with yellow on the bottom), and move your piece to one side of
				the cube (still on the bottom).
			</p>
			<figure class="cube" id="notMatch"></figure>
			<script>createCube("notMatch");</script>
			<figure class="cube" id="notMatchB"></figure>
			<script>createCube("notMatchB");</script>
			<p>If you have the first case, it can be solved by just turning the side
				with the matching color twice so that the white side of the piece
				attaches to the white center. (fig c below)
			</p>
			<p>The second case is a little more tricky. If your piece is on the left,
				you need to turn the left side once so that the side color matches
				(blue in the example), then turn the front until the white piece is on top,
				attached to the white center. (fig c) If its on the right, just do the same thing
				on the other side. However, if this is not your first cross piece,
				you will have just unsolved one of the others (red in the example),
				so you will then need to turn the left side (or right side)
				back the other way to fix it. The exact sequence of moves is
				<span class="alg">L' F L</span> (or <span class="alg">R F' R'</span>).
				To learn what these letters mean, visit this page: <a href="move_notation.html">
				How To Read Move Notation</a>. It will be very helpful to know later on.
			</p>
			<p>(For the curious: the move for the first case is just
				<span class="alg">F2</span>)
			</p>
			<figure class="cube" id="crossPiece"></figure>
			<script>createCube("crossPiece");</script>
			<p>To finish solving the cross, just repeat these steps for all four pieces.</p>
			<p>In the first step (connecting the piece to the yellow center),
				you may end up unsolving a cross piece above the piece you found.
				In that case, you need to move your new piece to one side, then turn the
				front side back to fix your already solved cross piece. Then you can
				continue with the steps to solve your new piece.
			</p>
			<p>You may also notice that a piece you find is already connected to its
				non-white center (for example, if your cube started already looking like fig a).
				If that is the case, you do not need to move it to the bottom first,
				you can just turn the front until the piece is on top.
			</p>

				<p>Wait! Before you go on!</p>
				<p>If you are just here to solve the rubik's cube once so that its no longer
					mixed up on your shelf, or just to have the satisfaction of doing it,
					then you can read on. 
				</p>
				<p>But if you are here to actually learn how to solve the rubik's cube,
					then don't go on yet! If you actually want to learn it, then you will
					need to practice. I recommend practicing each step until you can do it
					without looking back here for help.
				</p>
				<p>To practice the cross, just solve the cross, and then mix up the cube again
					and solve the cross again. Keep mixing it up and solving it until you have
					a good grasp of the steps and the ideas. Once you are comfortable picking
					up a cube and solving the cross without too much trouble, then you should
					go on to the next section.
				</p>
				<p>There will be one of these after every section telling you the best way
					to pratice each step because they are all different. I highly recommend
					pausing when you see each one to make sure you really understand what to do.
				</p>
			</div>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2 id="whiteCornersHead">Completing the First Layer</h2>
			<p>The next step in solving the rubik's cube is to solve the white corners.
				The completed step will look like this:
			</p>
			<figure class="cube" id="firstLayer1"></figure>
			<script>createCube("firstLayer1");</script>
			<p>You may have noticed in the figure that white is now on the bottom.
				For the rest of the solve, we want it that way. So flip over your cube now
				so that white is now on the bottom, and yellow is on top.
			</p>
			<p>First, we need to find a white corner. That just means any corner with white on it.
			</p>
			<p>Next, find the spot where it's supposed to go, then turn the top until the corner
				is directly above the spot where it is supposed to go.
			</p>
			<figure class="cube" id="cornerSlot"></figure>
			<script>createCube("cornerSlot");</script>
			<figure class="cube" id="cornerSlotL"></figure>
			<script>createCube("cornerSlotL");</script>
			<p>Now rotate the cube so that the corner is in front, and the white sticker
				is on the side (as shown in fig d). Depending on which way the piece
				is rotated, it may need to be on the left or the right.
			</p>
			<p>With white on the right, insert the corner like this: <span class="alg">R U R'</span>.
				This is called the <strong>right trigger.</strong> It will put in any corner
				on the right. If it's on the left use the <strong>left trigger:</strong>
				<span class="alg">L' U' L</span>.
			</p>
			<p>Notice that "inserting" or solving the corners is very similar to edges that are
				flipped the wrong way, but now we are turning the top instead of the front.
			</p>
			<figure class="cube" id="solvedCorner"></figure>
			<script>createCube("solvedCorner");</script>
			<p>There are two other cases that can happen as well. The corner piece may be
				already in the correct position, but oriented the wrong way, or it may be
				above its spot like it's supposed to, but the white sticker is facing up
				instead of to one side.
			</p>
			<figure class="cube" id="cornerInSlot"></figure>
			<script>createCube("cornerInSlot");</script>
			<figure class="cube" id="cornerUp"></figure>
			<script>createCube("cornerUp");</script>
			<p>For the first case, once again hold the cube so that the white sticker is
				facing to the side, then do the right trigger if it's facing right
				(or the left trigger if it's facing left). Then move the corner back over
				to above its spot, and do the right (or left) trigger again to put it in
				the correct way.
			</p>
			<p>For the second case, hold it on the right and do the right trigger.
				This will turn it into the first case, and you can solve it from there.
			</p>
			<aside>
				This skips the <span class="alg">R'</span> and <span class="alg">R</span>,
				and turns the two <span class="alg">U</span> moves into
				<span class="alg">U2</span>, creating the new move sequence
				<span class="alg">R U2 R' U'</span>
			</aside>
			<p>Once you do this, you may notice that you moved the corner down
				and then right back up. So you can actually just lift up the corner,
				and then turn the top twice instead of once, which will turn it into
				a normal corner, which you can solve using the right trigger.
			</p>
			<p>As before with the cross edge pieces, repeat the steps for each corner
				until you have solved the first layer.
			</p>
			<p>Watch the video below to see examples of each step.</p>
			<video controls poster="media/white_corners.png">
				<source src="media/white_corners.MP4" type="video/mp4" />

			</video>
			<div class="practice">
				<p>It's Practice Time again!</p>
				<p>To practice the white corners, I would recommend practicing the entire
					first layer (cross and corners) to solidfy both corner solving
					and the relationship between the edges and corners.
				</p>
			</div>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2 id="secondLayerHead">The Second Layer</h2>
			<p>The last thing to do before we get to the top layer is to solve the edges
				in the second layer. The completed step will look like this:
			</p>
			<figure class="cube" id="secondLayer1"></figure>
			<script>createCube("secondLayer1");</script>
			<p>Of course, we first need to find a second layer edge. A second layer edge
				is any edge that does not have yellow on it (or whatever your top color is).
				Once you have found one, turn the top until it matches with one of the centers.
				This will always be possible, there are no bad cases for this.
			</p>
			<figure class="cube" id="secondEdge"></figure>
			<script>createCube("secondEdge");</script>
			<figure class="cube" id="secondEdgeL"></figure>
			<script>createCube("secondEdgeL");</script>
			<p>Once you have your edge in place, make sure you are holding the cube
				so that the edge is on the front (as shown in fig f). This means
				that the spot it is supposed to go should also be on the front.
			</p>
			<p>Now turn the top to move the edge piece <em>away</em> from the spot it's
				supposed to go. This sets up the algorithm to put the edge in its spot
				(This step is included as the first <span class="alg">U</span> or
				<span class="alg">U'</span> move in the algorithm).
			</p>
			<aside>
				<p>In cubing, an <em>algorithm</em> is a sequence of moves.
					Any sequence of moves could be considered an algorithm, but we generally
					call something an algorithm when it does something useful, which usually
					means moving just a few pieces around to make sure we keep our current
					progress.
				</p>
			</aside>
			<p>The edge insertion algorithm goes like this: <span class="alg">
				U R U' R' y U' L' U L</span>. I think of it like this. You first take out
				the corner from its spot, and in doing so, you are pairing up the corner
				and the edge to be put back in together. You then put the corner back
				in a different way so it changes the cube.
			</p>
			<p>That is the essence of any good (useful) algorithm. Break some progress,
				then restore it in a different way. This will change something in the
				parts that you haven't solved yet, and move them around to solve them too.
			</p>
			<p>The edge insertion algorithm above is for edges that need to go on the right.
				There is also the left-side version of the algorithm, which is exactly the
				same, but on the other side: <span class="alg">U' L' U L y' U R U' R'</span>.
			</p>
			<p>That is all you need to know to solve the second layer. Once again, repeat it
				four times (once for each second layer edge) until you have solved the second
				layer of the rubik's cube!
			</p>
			<p>Sometimes you may find a second layer edge that is in the second layer,
				but not in the correct spot, or maybe it is in the correct spot but flipped around.
				To solve either of these cases, just insert a pretend edge, which will take out
				the bad edge. Then you can put the edge back in correctly.
			</p>
			<p>Watch the video below to see a full solve of the second layer.</p>
			<video controls poster="media/second_layer.png">
				<source src="media/second_layer.MP4" type="video/mp4" />
				<p><em>To play this video clip, your browser needs to support HTML5.</em></p>
			</video>
			<div class="practice">
				<p>To practice the second layer, the best way really is to scramble
					entire cube each time and practice all of the preceding steps
					to make sure you don't forget how to do them.
				</p>
			</div>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2 id="yellowCrossHead">The Yellow Cross</h2>
			<p>The yellow cross consists of two steps: <strong>Orientation of the edges</strong>
				and <strong>Alignment of the yellow cross</strong>.
				This is what the yellow cross look like:
			</p>
			<figure class="cube" id="yellowCross1"></figure>
			<script>createCube("yellowCross1")</script>
			<p>The first step is the orientation of the cross. That looks like this:</p>
			<figure class="cube" id="cross"></figure>
			<script>createCube("cross")</script>
			<p>Notice that the side colors of the cross don't matter yet. All we are doing
				in this step is making sure the yellow side of all the edges are facing up.
			</p>
			<p>There is one algorithm you need to learn for this step. It goes like this:
				<span class="alg">F R U R' U' F'</span>.
			</p>
			<p>There are four cases that can show up, as shown below.</p>
			<figure class="cube" id="dot"></figure>
			<script>createCube("dot")</script>
			<figure class="cube" id="lShape"></figure>
			<script>createCube("lShape")</script>
			<figure class="cube" id="line"></figure>
			<script>createCube("line")</script>
			<figure class="cube" id="cross1"></figure>
			<script>createCube("cross1")</script>
			<p>If you got the cross, you're already done! If you got one of the other cases,
				just do the algorithm and it will turn into the next case.
			</p>
			<aside>
				<p>If you don't have any of the cases listed above (in other words,
					if you have three edges correct, or only one edge correct) that means
					that someone has taken your cube apart and put an edge back in incorrectly.
				</p>
				<p>There is no way to fix this using only legal moves, so you will need to
					take your cube apart a little bit to take one of the bad edges out,
					so that you can put it back in correctly. Then you can continue solving
					it as normal.
				</p>
			</aside>
			<p>Make sure to hold the cube in the orientation shown in the examples.
				Hold the L-shape with one yellow edge pointing toward you, and the other
				pointing to the right. When solving the line, hold the cube so that the edges
				point to the left and the right.
				(The dot doesn't matter becuase it is the same from any direction).
			</p>
			<p>Watch the video below to see the orientation of the yellow cross explained.</p>
			<p>/Video explaining yellow cross/</p>
			<div class="practice">
				<p>To practice the yellow cross, you can just continue doing the cross
					algorithm.
				</p>
				<p>When practicing just the algorithm, don't worry about which case you have.
					Just do it a bunch of times until your fingers can do it without even thinking.
				</p>
				<p>Once you have the algorithm in muscle memory, then you should practice
					how to do each case. That means that you should scramble the entire cube
					and practice every step, making sure you end up with the yellow cross
					every time.
				</p>
			</div>
			<p id="alignedCrossHead">Now it is time to align the yellow cross.
				Here is the algorithm you need to know for this step:
				<span class="alg">R U R' U R U2 R'</span>.
			</p>
			<p>There are three cases that can come up during this step. Either the cross
				will already be aligned (hooray!) or there will be two cross pieces next
				to each other that need to switch (like the L-shape case in the last step),
				or finally there could be two across from each other that need to switch
				(like the line case in the last step). That means that there will always
				be at least two edges in the correct position.
			</p>
			<p>If you do not have two edges correct right now, turn the top layer until
				you do. This is always possible. There cannot be less than two correct.
			</p>
			<figure class="cube" id="adjacentEdges"></figure>
			<script>createCube("adjacentEdges")</script>
			<figure class="cube" id="oppositeEdges"></figure>
			<script>createCube("oppositeEdges")</script>
			<figure class="cube" id="fullCross"></figure>
			<script>createCube("fullCross")</script>
			<p>Similar to the previous step, you will hold the cube in a specific orientation
				to solve each case. However, instead of thinking about the solved pieces,
				now you need to think about the <em>unsolved</em> pieces. In other words,
				if you have two unsolved edges next to each other (L-shape case),
				hold one pointing towards you and the other pointing to the right.
				For the line case, hold the unsolved edges on the left and right.
			</p>
			<p>Once you are holding the cube the correct way, execute the algorithm to solve
				each case. The algorithm will turn the line case into the L-shape, and then
				doing the algorithm again will align the entire yellow cross.
			</p>
			<p>After doing the algorithm to solve the L-shape, you will not have any edges
				aligned to the correct centers, but you just need turn the top until
				the cross is solved.
			</p>
			<p>You now have the entire yellow cross solved! There are now only the yellow corners
				left to solve! To see me explain the alignment of the yellow cross,
				watch the video below.
			</p>
			<p>/Video explaining yellow cross/</p>
			<div class="practice">
				<p>Now it is time to practice what you have learned.</p>
				<p>First, practice the algorithm until you can do it with your eyes closed.</p>
				<p>Then you should scramble the cube a few times and practice everything you
					have learned up to this point. Make sure to practice each case!
				</p>
			</div>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2 id="positionedCornersHead">The Yellow Corners</h2>
			<p>You are on the last step! The cube is so close to being solved! You can do it!</p>
			<p>Obviously, after this step the cube will be solved, but for consistency's sake,
				this is what the cube will look like after you have finished this step ;)
			</p>
			<figure class="cube" id="solved1"></figure>
			<script>createCube("solved1")</script>
			<p>To start, we first put all of the corners in the right spot, then we will
				orient them correctly. This step is confusing to a lot of people, but it
				just turns that moving corners around is easier if we don't worry about their
				orientation, and it is also not too hard to turn corners while keeping them
				in the same position.
			</p>
			<p>To put the corners in the right spot, first look for any that are already correct.
				You are looking for a corner that has the same three colors on it as the edges
				around it, even though it may not match the colors next to it. Example below.
			</p>
			<figure class="cube" id="twistedCorner"></figure>
			<script>createCube("twistedCorner")</script>
			<p>There are three possibilities: either they are all correct already, or there is
				only one correct, or no corners are in the correct positions. You can never
				have only two. If you see two correct corners, that means that the other two
				must be correct as well.
			</p>
			<aside>
				If you somehow have two corners in the correct positions, and two in the incorrect
				positions, that means that the cube has been taken apart and two corners were
				switched. The only way to fix that is to physically take the two bad corners out
				and put them back in the correct positions.
			</aside>
			<p>If you find one correct corner, hold the cube so that the correct corner is
				in the front right position, and execute this algorithm: <span class="alg">
					L' U R U' L U R' U'</span>. If none are correct, hold it in any orientation
				and do the same algorithm.
			</p>
			<p>You may do the algorithm and then discover that you still only have one
				corner, or you still do not have any. In that case, just do it again.
				After doing the algorithm at most twice, you are guaranteed to get the next case.
			</p>
			<p>The video below explains the process of putting the yellow corner pieces
				in the correct spot.
			</p>
			<p>/Video explaining yellow corners/</p>
			<div class="practice">
				<p>Now practice your yellow corners!</p>
				<p>As before, practice the algorithm until you have it down, then scramble
					the cube and go back to the beginning to make sure you don't forget what
					you have learned.
				</p>
			</div>
			<p id="orientedCornersHead">At this point, every single piece on your cube will be in the correct position,
				and you will only have a few corners that need to be turned. It may be tempting
				to just forcefully turn them to the correct orientation, but that is not allowed
				in cubing. If you are just solving it so that it is no longer sitting mixed up
				on your shelf, you may feel justified in just turning them, but I promise you
				will not have the same satisfaction you would if you did it correctly all the
				way through.
			</p>
			<p>That being said, the last step is not that hard anyway.</p>
			<p>The algorithm you need to learn to solve twisted corners
				is just this: <span class="alg">R' D' R D</span>. That's it.
				Just hold a twisted yellow corner in the front right position and do that algorithm.
			</p>
			<p>However, just doing that once will not solve anything. It will look like
				you have just messed up the cube. That's because, to turn a corner, you need
				to do the algorithm twice. Doing it twice takes the corner out of its spot,
				turns it, and puts it back in (so it will be twisted from its original orientation).
			</p>
			<p>The rest of the cube will still look scrambled, but that's okay. All we
				care about right now is if the corner is solved. Once you have solve one,
				turn the top until a different twisted corner is in the front right position.
				<strong>(Important: do not turn the cube! Only turn the top!)</strong>
			</p>
			<aside>
				<p>If your cube is not solved once you have solved each twisted corner,
					that means that someone has twisted one and only one corner on your cube,
					which is not possible to solve using only legal moves.
				</p>
				<p>To fix it, keep doing the corner twist
					algorithm until the bottom of the cube is solved. This will make your
					corner unsolved again, so now you will have to twist it manually, which may
					involve taking the corner piece out and put it back in correctly.
				</p>
			</aside>
			<p>To finish solving the entire rubik's cube, just repeat that step for each
				corner. Once you have done all of them, your cube will be solved!
			</p>
			<p>Except that the top won't be aligned since you turned it to switch out the corners.
				So the very last step to solve the rubik's cube is just to turn the top face until
				your cube has the same colors on every side.
			</p>
			<p>To see another explanation of how to fix the orientation of the yellow corners,
				watch the video below.
