			<h2>Solving the Rubik's Cube</h2>
			<p>So you want to learn how to solve the rubik's cube?
				Well, in this article I will teach you a simple method
				to do just that.</p>
			<p>This tutorial may seem more complicated than others you have seen.
				While it is true that there are many tutorials that claim to
				solve the rubik's cube in 10 moves or less, they are all lying
				to you. There is no magic move or set of moves to solve the rubik's cube.
				Every person in history to have solved it either got lucky,
				or they followed a procedure to reduce any scramble to simple,
				manageable steps.</p>
			<p>This article goes through one of the simplest methods to solve
				a 3x3 rubik's cube known as the <em>Beginner Method.</em> There are many
				other methods out there, but they usually involve more complicated
				steps and have more things you need to learn and memorize.
				The most popular is known as <em>CFOP.</em>
				If you want a more advanced method, you should go check that out.</p>
			<p>The beginner method is a layer-by-layer approach, which means that
				instead of solving one color at a time, you split the cube into
				three "layers" stacked on top of one another.
				Each layer consists of multiple phases:</p>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>The First Layer:
						<ul>
							<li>The White Cross</li>
							<li>The White Corners</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The Second Layer:
						<ul>
							<li>Second Layer Edges</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The Third Layer:
						<ul>
							<li>The Yellow Cross
								<ul>
									<li>Orientation of the Edges</li>
									<li>Alignment of the Edges</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>The Yellow Corners
								<ul>
									<li>Positioning of the Corners</li>
									<li>Orientation of the Corners</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<h2>Solving the White Cross</h2>
			<p>First, you must solve the white cross. To do this,
				find an edge piece with white on it.
				Notice I said edge <em>piece.</em> This is important because
				while there are 54 stickers on the cube (6 sides with 9 stickers each),
				there are actually only 20 moving pieces.</p>
			<p>The colors on each piece are stuck together, and can never change.
				This means that for a piece to be solved, <em>all</em> the colors on it
				must match the sides they're on.</p>
			<p>There are three types of pieces:
				<ul>
					<li><b>Center pieces,</b> which have only one color, and do not move
					because they are all attached to each other.</li>
					<li><b>Edge pieces,</b> which have two colors, and touch the
					center pieces and corner pieces. And</li>
					<li><b>Corner pieces,</b> which have three colors,
					and only touch edge pieces.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>A common, and very natural, way to try to solve the rubik's cube
				is by solving one color or side at a time. But since pieces are
				inseparable, a better strategy is to solve the cube one <em>layer</em>
				at a time. The color most people start with is white, so in this tutorial
				the layer we will start with is white as well. You do not have
				to do it this way, but it makes it easier to understand the instructions.</p>
			<p>Ok, back to solving the white cross. When solved,
				the white cross will look like this.</p>
			<figure class="cube" id="wc"></figure>
			<script>
				createCube("wc");
			</script>
			<p>The first layer solved will look like this.</p>
			<figure class="cube" id="fl"></figure>
			<script>
				createCube("fl");
			</script>
