			<h2>Solving the Rubik's Cube</h2>
			<p>So you want to learn how to solve the rubik's cube?
				Well, in this article I will teach you a simple method
				to do just that.</p>
			<p>This tutorial may seem more complicated than others you have seen.
				While it is true that there are many tutorials that claim to
				solve the rubik's cube in 10 moves or less, they are all lying
				to you. There is no magic move or set of moves to solve the rubik's cube.
				Every person in history to have solved it either got lucky,
				or they followed a procedure to reduce any scramble to simple,
				manageable steps.</p>
			<p>This article goes through one of the simplest methods to solve
				a 3x3 rubik's cube known as the <em>Beginner Method.</em> There are many
				other methods out there, but they usually involve more complicated
				steps and have more things you need to learn and memorize.
				The most popular is known as <em>CFOP.</em>
				If you want a more advanced method, you should go check that out.</p>
			<p>The Beginner Method is a layer-by-layer approach, which means that
				instead of solving one color at a time, you split the cube into
				three "layers" stacked on top of one another.
				Each layer consists of multiple phases:</p>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>The First Layer:
						<ul>
							<li>The White Cross</li>
							<li>The White Corners</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The Second Layer:
						<ul>
							<li>Second Layer Edges</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The Third Layer:
						<ul>
							<li>The Yellow Cross
								<ul>
									<li>Orientation of the Edges</li>
									<li>Alignment of the Edges</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>The Yellow Corners
								<ul>
									<li>Positioning of the Corners</li>
									<li>Orientation of the Corners</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<h2>Solving the White Cross</h2>
			<p>First, you must solve the white cross.
				When you have finished this step, the cube will look like this
				(the gray pieces indicate that the piece could be any color,
				we don't care what the rest of the cube looks like right now):</p>
			<figure class="cube" id="whiteCross1"></figure>
			<script>createCube("whiteCross1");</script>
			<p>Each edge piece with white on it will be between the white center
				and the center of the other color on that piece. (For example,
				the white-blue edge piece is touching the white center and the blue center).</p>
			<aside>
				<p>Notice I said edge <em>piece.</em> This is important because
					while there are 54 stickers on the cube (6 sides with 9 stickers each),
					there are actually only 20 moving pieces.</p>
				<p>The colors on each piece are stuck together, and can never change.
					This means that for a piece to be solved, <em>all</em> the colors on it
					must match the sides they're on.</p>
				<p>There are three types of pieces:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Center pieces (6),</b> which have only one color, and do
							not move because they are all attached to each other.</li>
						<li><b>Edge pieces (12),</b> which have two colors, and touch the
							center pieces and corner pieces. And</li>
						<li><b>Corner pieces (8),</b> which have three colors,
							and only touch edge pieces.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>A common, and very natural, way to try to solve the rubik's cube
					is by solving one color or side at a time. But since pieces are
					inseparable, a better strategy is to solve the cube one <em>layer</em>
					at a time. The color most people start with is white, so in this tutorial
					the layer we will start with is white as well. You do not have
					to do it this way, but it makes it easier to understand the instructions.</p>
			</aside>
			<p>To start solving the rubik's cube, we hold the cube with the white
				center on top, which will put the yellow center on the bottom
				since they are always opposite from each other.</p>
			<p>We solve the white cross one piece at a time, so first,
				you need to find a white edge. To solve it, turn the cube until
				the piece is touching the yellow center (so the piece is on the bottom).
				Then turn the bottom until the side color of the piece matches one
				of the centers.</p>
			<figure class="cube" id="matchEdge"></figure>
			<script>createCube("matchEdge");</script>
			<figure class="cube" id="matchEdgeB"></figure>
			<script>createCube("matchEdgeB");</script>
			<p>If that's impossible, look at the color on the other side of the piece
				(on the bottom of the cube), and hold that color center facing towards you
				(still with yellow on the bottom), and move your piece to one side of
				the cube (still on the bottom).</p>
			<figure class="cube" id="notMatch"></figure>
			<script>createCube("notMatch");</script>
			<figure class="cube" id="notMatchB"></figure>
			<script>createCube("notMatchB");</script>
			<p>If you have the first case, it can be solved by just turning the side
				with the matching color twice so that the white side of the piece
				attaches to the white center. (fig c below)</p>
			<p>The second case is a little more tricky. If your piece is on the left,
				you need to turn the left side once so that the side color matches
				(blue in the example), then turn the front until the white piece is on top,
				attached to the white center. (fig c) If its on the right, just do the same thing
				on the other side. However, if this is not your first cross piece,
				you will have just unsolved one of the others (red in the example),
				so you will then need to turn the left side (or right side)
				back the other way to fix it. The exact sequence of moves is
				<code>L' F L</code> (or <code>R F' R'</code>). To learn what these letters mean,
				visit this page: <a href="#">move notation</a>. It will be very helpful
				to know later on.</p>
			<aside>The move for the first case is just <code>F2</code></aside>
			<figure class="cube" id="crossPiece"></figure>
			<script>createCube("crossPiece");</script>
			<p>To finish solving the cross, just repeat these steps for all four pieces.</p>
			<p>In the first step (connecting the piece to the yellow center),
				you may end up unsolving a cross piece above the piece you found.
				In that case, you need to move your new piece to one side, then turn the
				front side back to fix your already solved cross piece. Then you can
				continue with the steps to solve your new piece.</p>
			<p>You may also notice that a piece you find is already connected to its
				non-white center (for example, if your cube started already looking like fig a).
				If that is the case, you do not need to move it to the bottom first,
				you can just turn the front until the piece is on top.</p>

			<h2>Completing the First Layer</h2>
			<p>The next step in solving the rubik's cube is to solve the white corners.
				The completed step will look like this:</p>
			<figure class="cube" id="firstLayer1"></figure>
			<script>createCube("firstLayer1");</script>
			<p>You may have noticed in the figure that white is now on the bottom.
				For the rest of the solve, we want it that way. So flip over your cube now
				so that white is now on the bottom, and yellow is on top.</p>
			<p>First, we need to find a white corner. That just means any corner with white on it.</p>
			<p>Next, find the spot where it's supposed to go, then turn the top until the corner
				is directly above the spot where it is supposed to go.</p>
			<figure class="cube" id="cornerSlot"></figure>
			<script>createCube("cornerSlot");</script>
			<figure class="cube" id="cornerSlotL"></figure>
			<script>createCube("cornerSlotL");</script>
			<p>Now rotate the cube so that the corner is in front, and the white sticker
				is on the side (as shown in fig d). Depending on which way the piece
				is rotated, it may need to be on the left or the right.</p>
			<p>With white on the right, insert the corner like this: <code>R U R'</code>.
				This is called the <b>right trigger.</b> It will put in any corner on the right.
				If it's on the left use the <b>left trigger:</b> <code>L' U' L</code>.</p>
			<p>Notice that "inserting" or solving the corners is very similar to edges that are
				flipped the wrong way, but now we are turning the top instead of the front.</p>
			<figure class="cube" id="solvedCorner"></figure>
			<script>createCube("solvedCorner");</script>
			<p>There are two other cases that can happen as well. The corner piece may be
				already in the correct position, but oriented the wrong way, or it may be
				above its spot like it's supposed to, but the white sticker is facing up
				instead of to one side.</p>
			<figure class="cube" id="cornerInSlot"></figure>
			<script>createCube("cornerInSlot");</script>
			<figure class="cube" id="cornerUp"></figure>
			<script>createCube("cornerUp");</script>
			<p>For the first case, once again hold the cube so that the white sticker is
				facing to the side, then do the right trigger if it's facing right
				(or the left trigger if it's facing left). Then move the corner back over
				to above its spot, and do the right (or left) trigger again to put it in
				the correct way.</p>
			<p>For the second case, hold it on the right and do the right trigger.
				This will turn it into the first case, and you can solve it from there.</p>
			<p>As before with the edge pieces, repeat the steps for each corner until you have
				solved the first layer.</p>
			<p>Watch the video below to see examples of each step.</p>
